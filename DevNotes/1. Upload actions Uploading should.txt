1. Upload actions: Uploading should all be on a seperate table in a separate tab called uploads. Error logging: Errors live on a separate tab called errors. Assignment Grid: yes log all as mentioned including partial state. Swimlane: Initial placement: Add and give the new dates. Move Days: correct. Remove: correct. 2. Granularity: One row per action yes option A. You know what let's add an Event_ID column for the affected events as well, so the first mapmaking row has Event_ID also for Orlando, and the second row has Event_ID for Chicago. 3. Yes timestamp. 4. Yes but it only has the Event_ID as an entry if it was affected, so if we remove from Chicago (EV003 for example) then that row for remove has Event_ID as EV003. 6.  7. Yes though Old_Days break out into two columns: Old_First_Day, Old._Last_Day
